    "# Airline Passenger Satisfaction – EDA & KPI Design\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Business context & objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we analyse an open airline passenger satisfaction dataset to understand the drivers of satisfaction and dissatisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The perspective is that of a **Technical Product Owner** working in an Analytics Centre of Excellence (ACoE) for an airline. The focus is on:\n",
    "- Designing meaningful satisfaction and experience KPIs.\n",
    "- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) by key segments (class, travel type, loyalty, delays).\n",
    "- Translating findings into product and analytics questions that an ACoE would support.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key business questions:**\n",
    "- What proportion of passengers are satisfied vs neutral/dissatisfied?\n",
    "- How does satisfaction vary by customer type, travel purpose, and class?\n",
    "- Which service dimensions (e.g., online booking, wifi, seat comfort) differentiate satisfied from dissatisfied passengers the most?\n",
    "- How do departure and arrival delays affect satisfaction?"

    "## 2. Data overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we:\n",
    "- Load the airline passenger satisfaction dataset from Kaggle.\n",
    "- Inspect the schema (columns, datatypes, missing values).\n",
    "- Perform basic sanity checks on ranges and categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes on the dataset:**\n",
    "- Each row represents one passenger’s flight and survey response.\n",
    "- Target variable: overall satisfaction (e.g. `satisfied` vs `neutral or dissatisfied`).\n",
    "- Predictors include:\n",
    "  - Demographics (e.g. Age, Gender).\n",
    "  - Travel details (Customer Type, Type of Travel, Class, Flight Distance).\n",
    "  - Service ratings (seat comfort, inflight wifi, online booking, on-board service, cleanliness, etc.).\n",
    "  - Operational metrics (Departure Delay in Minutes, Arrival Delay in Minutes)."

    "## 3. Data cleaning & feature preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we:\n",
    "- Handle missing values (e.g., delays, service ratings) using sensible rules.\n",
    "- Normalise category values where needed.\n",
    "- Create a few helper features for analysis, such as:\n",
    "  - Age groups (e.g. `<25`, `25–40`, `40–60`, `60+`).\n",
    "  - Delay buckets (e.g. `0`, `1–15`, `16–60`, `>60` minutes).\n",
    "  - Binary indicators where helpful (e.g. `is_delayed`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is not heavy feature engineering but ensuring the data is clean and interpretable for KPI design."

    "_(PO perspective)_\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we define and compute the core KPIs that an airline ACoE might expose to stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example KPIs:**\n",
    "- Overall passenger satisfaction rate.\n",
    "- Satisfaction rate by:\n",
    "  - Customer Type (loyal vs disloyal).\n",
    "  - Type of Travel (business vs personal).\n",
    "  - Class (Business, Eco, Eco Plus).\n",
    "- Satisfaction vs delay:\n",
    "  - Satisfaction rate by departure delay bucket.\n",
    "  - Satisfaction rate by arrival delay bucket.\n",
    "- Satisfaction vs service ratings:\n",
    "  - Average rating per service dimension for satisfied vs dissatisfied passengers.\n",
    "  - Difference in averages to highlight biggest gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each KPI will be presented as:\n",
    "- A short table.\n",
    "- One or two clear visualisations (bar charts, grouped bars, or simple heatmaps).\n",
    "- A short narrative comment from a product/operations perspective."

    "- Age groups vs satisfaction.\n",

    "We:\n",
    "- Compare distributions of service ratings for satisfied vs dissatisfied passengers.\n",
    "- Identify which service dimensions have the largest difference between groups.\n",
    "- Highlight 3–5 service areas that appear most critical (e.g. online boarding, inflight wifi, seat comfort, on-board service).\n",
    "\n",
    "**5.3 Delay impact analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "We:\n",
    "- Examine the relationship between departure/arrival delays and satisfaction.\n",

    "- Comment on which delay thresholds are most harmful to experience."
