    "# Airline Passenger Satisfaction – Modeling & Product Backlog\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Objective recap\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds on the EDA & KPI analysis to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Train a simple classification model to predict whether a passenger is satisfied.\n",
    "- Understand which features are most important in predicting satisfaction.\n",
    "- Translate both EDA and modeling findings into a product backlog, including features, BAU items, NFRs, and technical debt from a Technical Product Owner perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is not to produce a perfect model, but to show how analytics insights can drive prioritisation and roadmap decisions."

    "\n",
    "We take a pragmatic, product-friendly modeling approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a clear target variable (satisfaction vs neutral/dissatisfied).\n",
    "- Include demographic, travel, service, and delay features.\n",
    "- Start with simple, interpretable models (e.g. logistic regression, basic tree-based models).\n",
    "- Focus on:\n",
    "  - Reasonable performance (e.g., accuracy, precision/recall).\n",
    "  - Interpretability of which features matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We explicitly note that this is a proof-of-concept analysis suitable for ACoE exploration and stakeholder conversations."

    "- Reuse the cleaned dataset from the EDA notebook (or repeat key cleaning steps).\n",
    "- Select the features to include (e.g. Age, Customer Type, Type of Travel, Class, service ratings, delays).\n",

    "- Split data into training and test sets.\n",

    "- “The model confirms that online boarding and seat comfort have strong influence on satisfaction.”\n",

    "### 7.1 Epics and features\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a small set of epics and example user stories derived from EDA and modeling findings. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Epic: Reduce dissatisfaction linked to delays**\n",
    "  - User story example:\n",
    "    - “As a business traveller, I want proactive, accurate updates when my flight is delayed so that I can manage my schedule and maintain trust in the airline.”\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Epic: Improve digital journey for economy passengers**\n",
    "  - User story example:\n",
    "    - “As an economy passenger, I want a smoother online booking and boarding process so that I can complete my journey with fewer frustrations.”\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Epic: Empower ACoE with better KPIs and dashboards**\n",
    "  - User story example:\n",
    "    - “As a CX manager, I want a dashboard that shows satisfaction and its drivers by segment (class, travel type, loyalty) so that I can prioritise service improvements.”\n",
    "\n",
    "For each epic, we can:\n",
    "- Tie it back to specific metrics (e.g., satisfaction uplift targets).\n",
    "- Mention which features in the model support the prioritisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.2 BAU analytics and monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "We outline BAU items that a TPO would oversee:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regular monitoring of key satisfaction KPIs by segment and service dimension.\n",
    "- Quarterly deep-dives into changing drivers of satisfaction.\n",
    "- A feedback loop where new survey or operational data is used to recalibrate KPIs and models.\n",
    "\n",
    "These items demonstrate ongoing product stewardship over the data & analytics product.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.3 Non-functional requirements (NFRs)\n",
    "\n",
    "We list relevant NFRs for an analytics/data product in this context, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data freshness (e.g., satisfaction KPIs updated daily).\n",
    "- Data quality thresholds for key fields (delays, service ratings, customer type, class).\n",
    "- Performance targets for dashboards (e.g., queries under a certain latency).\n",
    "\n",
    "We connect NFRs directly to user value:\n",
    "- “CX managers should be able to load segment-specific dashboards in under X seconds so they can use them during live meetings.”\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.4 Technical debt & data improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we identify technical debt and data-improvement tasks, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Standardising delay data and ensuring consistent capture across all routes.\n",
    "- Consolidating slightly redundant or ambiguous service rating fields.\n",
    "- Improving documentation (data dictionary, KPI definitions, ownership).\n",
    "\n",
    "We frame these as backlog items that support:\n",
    "- Compliance with enterprise data and analytics guidelines.\n",
    "- Long-term maintainability of the data product."
