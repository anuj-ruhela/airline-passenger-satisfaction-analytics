    "# Airline Passenger Satisfaction – EDA & KPI Design\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Business context & objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we analyse an open airline passenger satisfaction dataset to understand the drivers of satisfaction and dissatisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The perspective is that of a **Technical Product Owner** working in an Analytics Centre of Excellence (ACoE) for an airline. The focus is on:\n",
    "- Designing meaningful satisfaction and experience KPIs.\n",
    "- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) by key segments (class, travel type, loyalty, delays).\n",
    "- Translating findings into product and analytics questions that an ACoE would support.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key business questions:**\n",
    "- What proportion of passengers are satisfied vs neutral/dissatisfied?\n",
    "- How does satisfaction vary by customer type, travel purpose, and class?\n",
    "- Which service dimensions (e.g., online booking, wifi, seat comfort) differentiate satisfied from dissatisfied passengers the most?\n",
    "- How do departure and arrival delays affect satisfaction?"

    "_(PO perspective)_\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we define and compute the core KPIs that an airline ACoE might expose to stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example KPIs:**\n",
    "- Overall passenger satisfaction rate.\n",
    "- Satisfaction rate by:\n",
    "  - Customer Type (loyal vs disloyal).\n",
    "  - Type of Travel (business vs personal).\n",
    "  - Class (business, eco, eco-plus).\n",
    "- Satisfaction vs delay:\n",
    "  - Satisfaction rate by departure delay bucket.\n",
    "  - Satisfaction rate by arrival delay bucket.\n",
    "- Satisfaction vs service ratings:\n",
    "  - Average rating per service dimension for satisfied vs dissatisfied passengers.\n",
    "  - Difference in averages to highlight biggest gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each KPI will be presented as:\n",
    "- A short table.\n",
    "- One or two clear visualisations (bar charts, grouped bars, or simple heatmaps).\n",
    "- A short narrative comment from a product/operations perspective."

    "### 3.1 Segment analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We explore satisfaction across important segments, such as:\n",
    "- Class vs Type of Travel.\n",
    "- Customer Type vs Class.\n",
    "- Age groups vs satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each segment, we:\n",
    "- Visualise the distribution of satisfied vs dissatisfied.\n",
    "- Comment on where dissatisfaction is concentrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Service quality analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We:\n",
    "- Compare distributions of service ratings for satisfied vs dissatisfied passengers.\n",
    "- Identify which service dimensions have the largest difference between groups.\n",
    "- Highlight 3–5 service areas that appear most critical (e.g. online boarding, inflight wifi, seat comfort, on-board service).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Delay impact analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We:\n",
    "- Examine the relationship between departure/arrival delays and satisfaction.\n",
    "- Use delay buckets to see how satisfaction drops as delays increase.\n",
    "- Comment on which delay thresholds are most harmful to experience."

    "Examples of statements to capture:\n",
    "- Which segments (e.g. economy business travellers, disloyal customers) are at greatest risk of dissatisfaction.\n",
    "- Which service dimensions drive the largest change in satisfaction.\n",
    "- How strongly delays correlate with dissatisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each insight, we briefly outline:\n",
    "- Potential impact (e.g. churn risk, NPS impact, operational escalations).\n",
    "- Which stakeholder(s) should care (e.g. operations, digital product, customer experience)."
